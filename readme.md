# Multi Thread Renderer (v2)

cuz once I rebased my local version with an old one ToT



There will be a library header...

Only that header should be necessary to interface with an MTR lib. Which will be released as a dll once I'm done ironing out stuff.



(C) MTR's license is the same as SDL's cuz it uses it.

License is subject to change once (or if) I get rid of the SDL dependency and write my own rendering back-back-back-end
